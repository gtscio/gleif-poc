The test suite includes network resilience features:
- **Network Connectivity Checks:** Tests verify IOTA testnet availability before attempting blockchain operations
- **Fallback Mode:** When network is unavailable, tests use existing DID data for credential generation and verification

- **Comprehensive Reporting:** All test results are collected and reported, even when some tests fail

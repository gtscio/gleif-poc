# GLEIF vLEI ‚Üî TWIN ID Linkage Verifier

...

## üéØ Clarifying Our Approach: DID Linking vs. Domain Linkage

It's important to be precise about the verification methods this complete implementation provides.

- **W3C Domain Linkage:** This method involves an entity proving control over their own web domain (`my-company.com`) by hosting a credential there. It's a self-sovereign, highly technical approach.

- **DID Linking (Issuer-Based Method):** This method uses a trusted third party (in our case, a Qualified vLEI Issuer or QVI) to issue a credential that links the vLEI's `did:webs` to the TWIN ID's `did:iota`. The trust is anchored in the authority of the QVI.

**This PoC demonstrates both DID Linking and W3C Domain Linkage.** The DID Linking approach is highly scalable as it relies on a network of trusted issuers rather than requiring every business to manage its own public web infrastructure. The Domain Linkage flow lets the legal entity self-host a DID Configuration file on its own domain (demonstrated here by the Next.js app).

## Complete Cryptographic Implementation for Decentralized Legal Entity Verification

This project implements a full cryptographic system that links GLEIF vLEI (verifiable Legal Entity Identifier) credentials to TWIN IDs on the IOTA testnet using real keripy signing and verification operations. It enables trustless, transparent verification of legal entity identities using blockchain technology with actual cryptographic signatures and KERI database validation.

**üéØ Key Features Demonstrated:**

- ‚úÖ **DID Linking Verification:** Demonstrates the issuer-based linkage between a vLEI `did:webs` and a TWIN `did:iota`.
- ‚úÖ **Domain Linkage Verification:** Hosts a DID Configuration file and verifies the signed Domain Linkage credential served from the company website.
- ‚úÖ **Bi-directional Verification:** Confirms the link between traditional LEIs and decentralized DIDs.
- ‚úÖ **Live Blockchain Operations:** Uses the real IOTA testnet for DID management and NFT-based attestations.
- ‚úÖ **Secure Key Management:** Integrates with HashiCorp Vault for secure wallet operations.
- ‚úÖ **Blockchain Transparency:** Provides direct links to the IOTA Explorer for a public audit trail.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Current Scope:** This complete implementation uses real keripy signing and verification operations with actual cryptographic signatures and KERI database validation. A production-ready system would require integration with a GLEIF-accredited Qualified vLEI Issuer (QVI).

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The system consists of a frontend UI, a backend service for identity operations, a dedicated Python verification service for real keripy signing and verification operations, and integrations with Vault (using Transit Engine for secure key operations) and the IOTA testnet. This is now a complete cryptographic implementation, no longer a proof of concept with simulated components.

## üöÄ Getting Started

> **Note:** All setup commands should be run from the project root directory.

### üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

- Node.js v18+
- npm
- Docker
- `jq`
- Git

### üìÇ Project Structure

- `gleif-frontend/`: The Next.js UI, including the verification API route.
- `twin-service/`: Express backend for managing DIDs and NFTs.
- `verification-service/`: Python Flask service for KERI ACDC cryptographic verification.
- `did-management/`: Scripts for identity creation and credential generation.
  - `create-domain-linkage.js`: Requests a Domain Linkage credential and writes the DID Configuration file for the domain.
- `test-e2e.sh`: End-to-end testing script.

### ‚ö° Quickstart

You can run the project with or without HashiCorp Vault.

#### With Vault (Recommended)

1. **Start Vault and enable Transit Engine:**

   ```bash
     docker run -d --name vault-dev -p 8200:8200 -e VAULT_DEV_ROOT_TOKEN_ID=root hashicorp/vault server -dev
     sleep 5
     docker exec -e VAULT_ADDR=http://127.0.0.1:8200 vault-dev vault login root
     docker exec -e VAULT_ADDR=http://127.0.0.1:8200 vault-dev vault secrets enable transit
     docker exec -e VAULT_ADDR=http://127.0.0.1:8200 vault-dev vault write -f transit/keys/wallet-key
   ```

2. **Start the Backend:**

   ```bash
   cd twin-service && cp .env.vault .env && npm run start:vault
   ```

3. **Generate Credentials:**

   ```bash
   cd did-management && node manage-did.js && ./generate-credentials.sh $(jq -r '.did' twin-wallet.json)
   ```

   > This script now generates both the cryptographically valid QVI credential (DID Linking path) and the DID Configuration file containing the signed Domain Linkage credential. It also publishes the `LinkedDomains` service on the freshly created DID document so the frontend can host the domain proof.

4. **Start the Verification Service:**

   ```bash
   cd verification-service \
     && export GLEIF_ROOT_AID=$(jq -r '.i' ../gleif-frontend/public/.well-known/keri/gleif-incept.json) \
     && source venv/bin/activate \
     && PORT=5001 python3 app.py
   ```

5. **Start the Frontend:**

   ```bash
   cd gleif-frontend && npm run dev
   ```

> üëâ Services will be available at: **Frontend**: `http://localhost:3000`, **Backend**: `http://localhost:3001`, **Verification Service**: `http://localhost:5001`, **Vault**: `http://localhost:8200` (with Transit Engine enabled).

#### Without Vault

1. **Start the Backend:**

   ```bash
   cd twin-service && npm run dev
   ```

2. **Start the Frontend:**

   ```bash
   cd gleif-frontend && npm run dev
   ```

### Next Steps

After setup, the `generate-credentials.sh` script creates cryptographically valid credentials including a QVI-issued DID Linking credential and a Domain Linkage credential hosted in the DID Configuration file. These credentials link the vLEI `did:webs` to the TWIN `did:iota`, and the script publishes the `LinkedDomains` service on the DID document for frontend hosting. For deterministic verification, restart the Verification Service after credential generation (or re-export `GLEIF_ROOT_AID`) so it starts with the fresh artifacts.

To access and test the frontend, navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser. Enter a TWIN DID (e.g., from `twin-wallet.json`) to verify the linkage and generate an attestation NFT on the IOTA testnet.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How the Implementation Works

This complete implementation demonstrates a full, end-to-end flow for decentralized identity verification using real KERI cryptographic operations.

### Verification Flow

1. **Identity Resolution:** Resolves TWIN IDs directly from the IOTA Distributed Ledger.
2. **KERI Credential Verification:** Performs full cryptographic verification of KERI ACDC credentials through the dedicated Python verification service using real keripy signing and verification operations, validating the complete issuance chain from Legal Entity ‚Üí QVI ‚Üí GLEIF with actual cryptographic signatures and KERI database validation.
3. **Blockchain Attestation:** Creates an immutable attestation on the IOTA testnet, consisting of:
   - **Attestation DID:** A permanent DID document containing the verified identity information.
   - **Verification NFT:** An NFT with immutable metadata storing the DID document for easy sharing and verification.
4. **Explorer Integration:** Provides direct links to the IOTA Explorer to view the on-chain attestation and NFT.

### What Gets Stored on the Blockchain

| Component           | Content                                                                         | Purpose                                                   |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Attestation DID** | Complete IOTA DID document (keys, endpoints, revocation info).                  | An immutable, resolvable record of the verified identity. |
| **NFT Metadata**    | The DID document (as a JSON string) and verification details (vLEI, timestamp). | A user-friendly, shareable proof of the verification.     |

This process proves that a specific IOTA DID, controlled by a valid wallet, was verified to be linked to a GLEIF vLEI at a specific time through full cryptographic verification using real keripy signing and verification operations with actual cryptographic signatures and KERI database validation, ensuring tamper-proof identity validation.

## üéØ Business Value & Vision

### Key Benefits

- **Decentralized Trust:** Verification does not require a central intermediary.
- **Blockchain Immutability:** Creates a permanent, tamper-proof audit trail.
- **Interoperability:** Bridges traditional financial identity systems (LEI) with Web3 ecosystems (DID/NFT).
- **Cost-Effective:** Reduces the complexity and cost of identity verification.

### Implementation Models

- **Self-Hosted:** Organizations manage their own vLEI event logs and credentials on their web servers. This offers maximum control with zero infrastructure cost but requires technical expertise.
- **QVI as a Service:** A Qualified vLEI Issuer (QVI) handles all credential management, providing an additional layer of trust and simplifying adoption for non-technical organizations.

## üîÆ From Implementation to Production

### üö® Critical Missing Component: QVI Accreditation

The most critical step toward a production system is validating that the vLEI credential issuer is a **GLEIF-accredited QVI**.

| Feature                   | ‚úÖ Implementation Status                    | ‚ùå Production Requirement                                 |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Issuer Validation**     | Accepts any matching credential locally.    | Must verify the issuer is a GLEIF-accredited QVI via API. |
| **Trust Chain**           | Verifies a direct DID ‚Üî vLEI link.          | Must verify the full chain: GLEIF ‚Üí QVI ‚Üí vLEI ‚Üí TWIN ID. |
| **Revocation Status**     | Uses a static credential registry.          | Must check for real-time credential revocation status.    |
| **Official LEI Registry** | Does not cross-check with the LEI registry. | Must perform an official LEI registry cross-check.        |

### Implementation Roadmap

- **Phase 1 (MVP):** Integrate the GLEIF QVI Registry API to validate issuer accreditation.
- **Phase 2:** Implement the full trust chain verification and real-time revocation checks.
- **Phase 3:** Add enterprise features like monitoring, alerting, and compliance reporting.
